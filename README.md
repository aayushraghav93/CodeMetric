## Description

CodeMetric retrieves live user data from the LeetCode GraphQL API and presents it through a highly intuitive and visually engaging interface. It breaks down progress across **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** difficulty levels, offering:

- **Dynamic progress indicators** that instantly show solved vs. available problems per difficulty.
- **Submission stats cards** that clearly display total submissions and breakdowns by difficulty.
- **Clear data-driven motivation**, helping developers quickly assess strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Minimal and fast performance**, implemented with vanilla JavaScript and CSS—no heavy frameworks needed.

This tool is ideal for developers seeking a streamlined, real-time view of their LeetCode journey—with clarity, speed, and simplicity at its core.



## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

- **Modern UI/UX**: Refine the interface using CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap, and introduce subtle animations for better user experience.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Expand functionality to include stats from platforms such as Codeforces, HackerRank, and AtCoder for consolidated tracking.
- **Historical Analytics**: Enable trend visualization over time (e.g., solves per week/month) with chart libraries like Chart.js or ApexCharts.
- **User Accounts**: Add GitHub or other OAuth-based logins to maintain personalized dashboards and store historical metrics.
